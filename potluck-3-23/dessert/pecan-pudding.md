1. Preheat oven to 160Â°C. Grease a 25cm (1.25L capacity) round baking dish and line the base and side with baking paper (the lining here is optional).
2. Spread both sides of the bread with butter and cut each slice in half widthwise. Set aside.
3. Place the eggs and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until combined, then stir in cocoa and half of the chocolate.
4. Place the cream, vanilla and orange zest in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and bring just to a simmer. While stirring gently with a whisk, pour the hot cream mixture over the egg mixture and stir continuously until the chocolate has melted. Stir in the milk to cool the mixture, strain through a fine sieve and set aside.
5. Arrange bread upright in prepared pan, sprinkling pecans, sultanas and remaining chocolate between each piece. Pour chocolate cream mixture over, making sure all bread is coated. Set aside for 15-20 minutes for bread to soak up mixture. Bake for 35-40 minutes until edges are set but centre has a wobble. Remove from oven and set aside to cool slightly. Dust with cocoa and serve with ice cream.
