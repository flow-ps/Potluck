Preparation
Roast the chicken: Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
Pat the chicken dry with paper towels, including inside the cavity, then season the cavity with 1 tablespoon kosher salt.
In a small bowl, mix together the butter, garlic powder, pepper, thyme, lemon zest and 2 teaspoons of kosher salt until well combined. Rub the butter mixture all over the outside of the chicken, including under the skin, making sure to rub the thighs and legs as well as the breast.
Add the lemon quarters, onion, and garlic to the cavity of the chicken.
To truss the chicken, use a piece of butcher’s twine to tie the legs together so the bird holds a nice shape. Tuck the wingtips underneath the breasts so that they fit snugly. Transfer the chicken, breast-side up, to a roasting rack set inside a roasting pan.
Roast the chicken for 60–80 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken thigh reaches 165°F (75°C). Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.
Transfer the chicken to a large cutting board, reserving the juices in the roasting pan. Use a sharp knife to cut the legs and breasts away from the chicken carcass. Remove the skin from the chicken and transfer to the bowl of an Instant Pot, then pull the meat from the bones and shred into ½-inch pieces. Add the bones and carcass to the bowl with the skin. Transfer 4 cups of chicken to an airtight container for the pot pie filling and refrigerate until ready to use. Save any remaining chicken in a separate airtight container for another use; it will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
Make the chicken stock: Add the onion, garlic, carrot, celery, peppercorns, thyme, parsley, and bay leaf to the Instant Pot bowl with the chicken skin, bones, and carcass. Pour in enough water to cover the chicken by 1 inch, then add the reserved chicken juices.
Put the lid on the Instant Pot and set to pressure cook on high for 45 minutes. Once the timer goes off, turn the Instant Pot to quick release. Strain the chicken stock into a large bowl and discard the solids. Set aside 3 cups of stock at room temperature for the pot pie filling. Transfer the remaining chicken stock to an airtight container and save for another use; it will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or up to 6 months in the freezer.
Make the pie dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and kosher salt. Add the butter and toss to coat each cube in the flour, then smash each piece of butter with your fingertips into lima bean-sized pieces. It’s okay if some pieces are larger than others.
Add the ice, water, and vodka to a small bowl and stir to combine. Add 1–2 tablespoons at a time to the flour mixture and toss with a rubber spatula until the dough holds together when pressed between your hands. You may not need all of the liquid. The dough should not be very tacky or sticky.
Turn the dough onto a clean surface and use a bench scraper to gently bring it together into a rectangle. Fold the dough into thirds, like a business letter. Turn the dough 90°, then flatten and fold into thirds again. Repeat until all of the bits of dough have been incorporated and it just comes together in a smooth, cohesive mass. Do not overwork. Divide the dough in half and wrap each portion tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to 3 days.
Make the filling: Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add onion, carrots, potatoes, and thyme and season with 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook until the onion starts to soften, about 5 minutes.
Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until no lumps remain and the flour is evenly incorporated into the butter, 2–3 minutes.
Slowly whisk the reserved 3 cups of chicken stock, a little at a time. Simmer until the stock has reduced and thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the heavy cream and stir to combine.
Remove the pot from the heat and fold in the reserved 4 cups of shredded chicken, peas, and parsley. Season with more kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Transfer the filling to a large bowl and let cool to room temperature, then place in the freezer for 15 minutes.
Assemble the pot pie: Place a portion of pie dough on a floured surface. Sprinkle flour on top of the dough and on the rolling pin, then roll the dough into a 12-inch (30 cm) round, about ⅓ inch thick, rotating 90° every few rolls. Repeat with the remaining dough, rolling out slightly thinner to ¼ inch thick. Roll the thicker dough round onto the rolling pin and transfer to a 9-inch (22 cm) glass deep dish pie plate, gently lifting and pressing so the dough is flush against the dish. Brush the inside of the dough with the egg wash, including the sides and outer rim. Add the chilled filling, spreading evenly.
Drape the remaining dough round over the pie. Trim any excess dough around the edges, then pinch the top and bottom doughs together to seal. Roll the edges under, all the way around the pie dish, and crimp using the knuckle of an index finger of one hand and the thumb and index finger of the other.
Brush the egg wash all over the top of the dough, getting in the grooves and sides of the pie. Use a paring knife to cut a few vents in the top to allow the steam to escape. Sprinkle flaky sea salt on top. Chill the assembled pie in the refrigerator for 20 minutes, until firm.
Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.
Place the pie dish on the prepared baking sheet, then transfer to the oven and bake for 40–50 minutes, rotating halfway through, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.
Let cool for 15–20 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
